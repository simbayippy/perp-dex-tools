# Exchange Client Library
# IMPORTANT: Install the shared exchange library with exchange SDKs:
#
# Option 1: Install all exchanges (may have dependency conflicts):
#   pip install -e './exchange_clients[all]'
#
# Option 2: Install specific exchanges (recommended to avoid conflicts):
#   pip install -e './exchange_clients[lighter,grvt,edgex,backpack,aster]'
#
# Option 3: Install exchanges separately if conflicts occur:
#   pip install -e './exchange_clients[lighter]'
#   pip install -e './exchange_clients[paradex]'  # Install separately due to eth-account conflict
#
# Available exchanges: lighter, grvt, edgex, backpack, paradex, aster
# Note: lighter + paradex may conflict due to eth-account/eth-wallet dependencies
